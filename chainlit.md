# Welcome to the Geolocation Assistant! 🌍

I'm here to help you find locations based on their coordinates (latitude and longitude).

## How to use
1. Provide both latitude and longitude coordinates
2. I'll tell you the exact location of those coordinates
3. If you don't provide coordinates, I'll ask you for them

Example: "What's the location at latitude 48.8584 and longitude 2.2945?"

# Configuration
chat_input_placeholder: Enter coordinates (e.g., "What's at latitude 40.7128, longitude -74.0060?")
